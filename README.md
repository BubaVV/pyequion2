# PyEquIon

A pure python implementation for electrolytes chemical equilibrium.

Repository at https://github.com/pyequion/pyequion

=======
## Features

- Pure python package: hence it is easy to install in any platform
- Calculation of equilibrium of inorganic salts in water solution with precipitation and degassing
- Automatic determination of reactions
- Provides information as: Ionic Strength, pH, Electric Conductivity and the concentrations of each species as well their activity coefficient
- A modular approach for the activity coefficient calculation allows the usage of new thermodynamic models
- Calculation of equilibrium and reaction fluxes at reacting solid interfaces
- An incorporated GUI for ease-of-use

## Installation

The package can be installed with `pip install pyequion` or `pip install <folder>`
